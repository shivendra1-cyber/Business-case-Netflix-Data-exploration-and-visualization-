# Business-case-Netflix-Data-exploration-and-visualization-
The data analytics project built in Google Colab using NumPy and Pandas is a business case analysis of Netflix data exploration and visualization. The project is hosted on GitHub by the user shivendra1-cyber and aims to investigate and analyze various aspects of Netflix's business.

The project begins by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy and Pandas, and loading the Netflix dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The dataset contains information on Netflix's TV shows and movies, including their titles, release years, ratings, and genres, among others.

The project then explores the data using various Pandas and NumPy functions to gain insights into Netflix's business, such as the most popular genres, the distribution of ratings, and the release patterns of TVTV shows and movies. The project also creates visualizations using the Seaborn library to help communicate these insights in a more intuitive way.

The project's ultimate goal is to provide a deeper understanding of Netflix's business and identify potential areas for improvement or future investment. By using data analytics techniques and tools, such as Pandas and NumPy, the project is able to provide valuable insights that can inform business decisions and drive growth.

Overall, this project is a great example of how data analytics can be used to analyze and understand complex business data, and how Pandas and NumPy can be leveraged to manipulate and explore data in a way that is both insightful and informative.
